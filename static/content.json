Because of this, her mom started a summer theater camp called, Backyard Theatre, which Caitlin now co-directs if she’s not on the road performing!<br><br>Caitlin continued to pursue music and dance throughout grade school, then moved on to earn a BFA in Musical Theatre from Pace University in Manhattan.<br><br>Caitlin has been fortunate enough to perform in numerous regional venues across the country. When not performing, she is a freelance Wellness Advocate/Holistic Health Coach with doTERRA, an essential oils company.<br><br>Caitlin is based in NYC where she lives happily with her boyfriend, Christopher and their mini pin, Kya!",
